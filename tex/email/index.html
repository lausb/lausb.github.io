<!-- l. 13 --><p class='noindent'><a href='http://lausb.github.io'>Shibo Liu</a>, January 25, 2023
</p><!-- l. 15 --><p class='indent'>   We know that in Gmail, we can compose math formulas via LaTeX, provided you have install the “TeX for Gmail” addon in
Chrome. How to send emails containing math formula from an arbitrary email account (such as <span class='obeylines-h'><span class='verb'><span class='fvmr8t-x-x-120'>sliu@fit.edu</span></span></span>)? I have an
idea.

<li class='enumerate' id='x1-1002x1'>
         <!-- l. 18 --><p class='indent'>     Login Gmail in Chrome, after filling your non-Gmail email address (such as <span class='obeylines-h'><span class='verb'><span class='fvmr8t-x-x-120'>sliu@fit.edu</span></span></span>) from where you want
         to send the email, move to the area for composing the text of your email and press Shift + F8 button. Now you
         can compose your email using LaTeX code. When you complete a pair of $ or $$, the codes will be converted into
         math formula automatically, as demonstrated below:

         </p><!-- l. 22 --><p class='noindent'><img alt='PIC' height='569' src='em-5.png' width='569' />
            </p></li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-1004x2'>
         <!-- l. 24 --><p class='indent'>     When you have composed the email, press the Send button sending this email to the non-Gmail email address
         (for example <span class='obeylines-h'><span class='verb'><span class='fvmr8t-x-x-120'>sliu@fit.edu</span></span></span>, as shown above). Then, login to that email account, forward the email to the desired
         recipient (maybe you need to delete “Fw” in the Subject line, and other redundant information at the beginning of
         the email). The recipient will receive your email containing beautiful math formulas.
         </p><!-- l. 27 --><p class='indent'>   The following figure shows the email with math formulas received by the third party (the desired recipient). You
         can see that it was sent from <span class='obeylines-h'><span class='verb'><span class='fvmr8t-x-x-120'>sliu@fit.edu</span></span></span>, not from Gmail.
         </p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'><img alt='PIC' height='569' src='em-6.png' width='569' />
         </p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'><span class='favb8t-x-x-120'>Remark.   </span>After  I  got  this  idea,  I  learned  from  an  answer  to  a  post  (shared  to  me  by  a  friend  in  Taiwan)  of
         <a href='https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/118246/how-to-send-an-email-with-latex?fbclid=IwAR2MuP-6pXl3Re6pNxlj1E1_bvi5T7dsJFkx26UZT49gWbBQ1ArpEQJyTs4&amp;mibextid=BUZLm6'>StackExchange</a> (See the answer provided by Omar Hijab) that one can also copy the text (with the math generated
         via “TeX for Gmail”) from the composing box of Gmail, then paste into the composing box of your non-Gmail email
         account. I have tested this approach and it works well. I could not observe any difference in the result between
                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                           
         the two approaches.

<li class='enumerate' id='x1-1006x3'>     When receiving the email, your recipient can select the text (including the math formulas and symbols) and
         copy + paste to a TXT editor. The LaTeX codes of the math will be recovered (without the $ or $$, which have to
         be added manually). This is another advantage of this method.

         <!-- l. 36 --><p class='indent'>     Some email service (such as iCloud of Apple) does not support displaying the picture of the formulas. If your
         recipient use this kind of email address, instead of pressing Shift + F8, you should press Shift + F9 to use the
         “Simple math” mode, which can be supported in all known email service with poorer quality:
         </p><!-- l. 38 --><p class='indent'>   Composing the email in Gmail (with Shift + F9), that will be sent to Apple iCloud email address:

            </p></li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-1010x5'>     You can press the “TeX” button near the “Send” button in Gmail to see what options are available.
